# NYT Election needle - Will Oremus
https://gen.medium.com/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-needle-9bfed8f41023

Four years ago, a New York Times election graphic earned a place in media
infamy. For much of the night, “the needle” — a quivering indicator of which
candidate is more likely to win, updated in real time as data pours in — showed
Hillary Clinton as the favorite. And then, suddenly, it didn’t.

As the needle swung in Trump’s direction around 9 p.m., it became much more than
a data visualization. For Clinton voters, it became an encapsulation of
everything that was going terribly, unfathomably wrong: The fate of the country
and democracy distilled to a lone meter that was suddenly pointing to “red
alert.” Pundits and media theorists would later dissect its journalistic merits
and failings, but its memory lives on most vividly as a jittery icon of liberal
trauma.

“The most difficult part of many visualization projects, and certainly of this one, was distilling a complex, messy dataset into a clean visualization with a clear takeaway,” says Eastwood.

# Reuters COVID tracker
https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/

many data journalists faced the challenge of creating live trackers that pulled data from different sources to generate real-time graphics with text, telling us the story of the pandemic

We spoke to Prasanta Kumar Dutta, from Reuters’ design and development team,
about what differentiated this tracker from the rest: “Reuters also took on the
hard task of tracking the vaccination policies that determined who had access to
COVID-19 vaccines in countries around the world. That meant creating a unifying
structure to catalogue the different phases of each country's vaccination
rollout plan.”

# Panama Papers - International Consortium of Investigative Journalists

January 2017 - The Panama Papers expose the internal operations of one of the
world’s leading firms in incorporation of offshore entities, Panama-
headquartered Mossack Fonseca. The 2.6 terabyte trove of data at the core of
this investigation contains nearly 40 years of records, and includes information
about more than 210,000 companies in 21 offshore jurisdictions.

 The 2.6 terabytes of data that make up the Panama Papers files were obtained by German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared with ICIJ and more than 100 media partners.

Our network of trusted members encompasses 280 of the best investigative reporters from more than 100 countries and territories. 

# Satelite Journalism

An exponential growth in the number of small, privately owned satellites has opened wide new vistas
for investigative reporting.

Nearly 500 satellites and
other space objects were sent into Earth orbit or beyond in 2017, nearly doubling the
number launched in 2016 (UN, 2018)

So, what’s in it for the media?
Journalists have been quick to exploit these new opportunities to cover events where it may
be too difficult, dangerous or costly to put reporting teams on the ground. Media access to
satellite company images data bases has resulted, in some cases, journalists gaining a near
real-time reporting source for breaking stories.

Satellite imagery has already provided ‘smoking-gun’ evidence for award-winning
investigative reporting of human rights abuses (Htusan et al., 2015). Digital, TV and print all
carry growing numbers of satellite imagery-led exposes of environmental destruction in
remote locations such as the Amazon (Weir, 2017), before and after imagery of natural
disasters (Murphy, 2018), analyses of military build-ups such as China’s construction of
artificial islands in the South China Sea (Wu et al., 2018), missile launches and nuclear
testing in North Korea (Fifield and Taylor, 2018).

Environmental monitoring: The La Pampa gold mine in Peru. In 2016, mining operations were extended
south of the Malinowski River, illegally entering the Tambopata National Reserve—a protected forest. The
Amazon Conservation Association used Planet data to publish a series of alerts which tracked hundreds of
hectares of illegal expansion and mapped alterations to the course of the Malinowski River. According to
Planet, the Peruvian government intervened and actively targeted illegal mining operations inside the
reserve (4 images – Planet Labs
