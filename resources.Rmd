- Royal Statistical Society [Best Practices for Data Visualisation](https://royal-statistical-society.github.io/datavisguide/): Insights, advice, and examples (with code) to make data outputs more readable, accessible, and impactful.
- [Financial Times Visual Vocabulary](papers/Visual-vocabulary.pdf). A large cheatsheet poster for fining types of graphs to use for different purposes.  
- [Checklist For Good Graphical Practice](GraphicsChecklist.html). From From: Gordon & Finch (2015), a useful set of questions and suggestions to apply to graphs designed for presentation purposes.
- [Twenty rules for good graphics](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/graphics/). This post by Rob Hyndman, describes some _best practices_ for producing
graphs for _journal publication_.

- [British Ecological Society's Guide to Reproducible Science](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/guide-to-reproducible-code.pdf). The guide proposes a simple reproducible project workflow, and a guide to organizing projects for reproducibility. The Programming section provides concrete tips and traps to avoid (example: use relative, not absolute pathnames), and the Reproducible Reports section provides a step-by-step guide for generating reports with R Markdown.

## Presentation/project ideas <img src="images/icons/teacher.png" height=30>  {#project-ideas}

Here are a few ideas (in no particular order) for the course presentation or project:

* [Winners of the ASA Police Data Challenge student visualization contest](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/12/police-data-challenge.html). The American Statistical Association teamed up with the [Police Data Initiative](https://www.policedatainitiative.org/), which provides open data from local law enforcement agencies in the US, to create a competition for high school and college students to analyze crime data from Baltimore, Seattle and Cincinnati.  Explore some data and create your own visualization.

* Somewhat related, [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php) maintains a large set of datasets, one of which details [Fatal police shootings](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=fatal_police_shootings) by on-duty officers since Jan. 2015.
Collected by the Washington Post. This includes 6400 incidents, with many variables on the nature of the incident and the age, race, sex of the victim.

* [The 50 Most Influential Living Psychologists](https://thebestschools.org/features/most-influential-psychologists-world/). This page gives brief biographies of a collection of 50 living psychologists called the most influential in the world. How can this collection be visualized in terms of their attributes (area of psychology, age, gender, ...)?  You'll need to scrape the data from the web page.  Here is a start on that:

```{r influential, eval=FALSE}
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
url <- "https://thebestschools.org/features/most-influential-psychologists-world/"
page <- read_html(url)
items <- page %>% html_nodes("h3") %>% html_text() 
items <- items[grep("More", items, invert=TRUE)]
items <- sub("^\\d+\\. ", "", items, perl=TRUE)
```


* [Graphical inference for Info Vis](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5613434/). Wickham et al. (2010) describe a graphical "lineup" technique for doing statistical inference with graphs and human judges.  Do a literature review of this topic and design a possible experimental use of this technique. There is an R package, [nullabor](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nullabor) with this
[vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nullabor/vignettes/nullabor.html) for contstructing such graphical displays.

* **Best practices** for research presentations using data graphics: How to best communicate your results in a conference presentation or in a poster?

* **Redesigning maps** for usability: One of the best early examples is [Harry Beck's London Tube Map](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/culture-and-heritage/art-and-design/harry-becks-tube-map), which has become iconic. But there have been many other additions to the literature on this topic.  Some local examples of maps that could use a design-overhaul are:
    * The [Toronto PATH map](http://torontopath.com/path-map/), showing the 30 km of walkways underneath a large part of the dpowntown core.
    * The [York Campus Map](http://maps.info.yorku.ca/files/2013/02/KEELE_Map_Colour.pdf), showing all buildings on the Keele Campus.  

* **Language of Graphs**: Characteristics of different computer languages for graphics, including aspects of syntax, semantics and expressive power. See me for some pointers and references.
  * Nicolas Kruchten [Metrics for Reasoning About the Usability of Visualization Notations](https://medium.com/multiple-views-visualization-research-explained/metrics-for-reasoning-about-the-usability-of-visualization-notations-6c03b9292780)

* **Online experiments**: More and more psychologists are using computer-controlled methods of data collection, either with specific software for personal computers or with web-based or cloud-based application.  Some of these use graphics, either for stimulus presentation or for displaying results.

* **Measures of graph literacy**: In many studies of graph perception, it is useful to measure a construct of ability to understand graphic information ("graph literacy"). What is the state of the art on this topic?
  * Michael Correll [The Mythos of Visualization Literacy](https://mcorrell.medium.com/the-mythos-of-visualization-literacy-5dd02db56254)
  * Lee et al. [VLAT : Development of a Visualization Literacy Assessment Test](https://www.bckwon.com/pdf/vlat.pdf)
  * Mirta Galesic [Graph Literacy: A Cross-Cultural Comparison](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=2c8dbb39ecec6e6ca27aabe1f84a134c4adef60a)
  * Related: [Aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia) - inability to "see" mental images, and some scales for measuring the same.

* **Accessibility**: Making graphics accessible to the visually impaired. A simple example is **ALT** text, now increasingly used.  Are there standards or tools available? See the links under [Human factors](#week5) above.

  * Somewhat related: Data **sonification & haptics**-- using sound and other modalities, e.g., [Loud Numbers](https://www.loudnumbers.net/); the [Data Sonification Archive](https://sonification.design/); Google's [TwoTone](https://twotone.io/), a free open-source web app to turn data into music
  * [Erie: A Declarative Grammar for Data Sonification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00156). Describes how a sonification maps data variables to sound variables like time, pitch, and volume. E.g., an auditory histogram can map bins to time and the count to pitch.

* **Other dataviz & graphic software**: 
  + [Observable](https://observablehq.com/), a dynamic, extensible graphics system built on [D3](https://d3js.org/), a free, open-source JavaScript library for visualizing data
  + [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), a graphic design system, often used to "gussy-up" plots done with R.
  + Python graphics libraries: [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/v0.12.4/), an implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python based on `ggplot2`.  There are many other [Python libraries for data visualization](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/business-intelligence-and-visualization/python-data-visualization-libraries): [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [plotly](https://plotly.com/), ...

* **Data physicalization**: representation of data by physical objects
  + [Opportunities and Challenges for Data Physicalization](http://yvonnejansen.me/dataphys)
  + [Data physicalization wiki](http://dataphys.org/). A collection of links and resources on the topic.
