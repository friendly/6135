## Class discussion forum

This term we will be using eClass for class discussion. The system is designed to make it
easier to communicate with your classmates, the TA, and myself.
Rather than emailing questions to a listserv or to us individually, 
I encourage you to post your questions on eClass. 

Students in the course are automatically subscribed.

## Summary

This course is designed as a lecture/seminar dealing with data visualization from a largely psychological and historical perspective. 

## Course Description {#description}

Information visualization is the pictorial representation of data. 

* Successful visualizations capitalize on our capacity to recognize and understand patterns presented in information displays. 
* Conversely, they require that writers of scientific papers, software designers and other providers of visual displays understand what works and what does not work to convey their message. 

This course will examine a variety of issues related to data visualization from a largely psychological perspective, but will also touch upon other related communities of research and practice related to this topic:

* history of data visualization, 
* computer science and statistical software,
* visual design, 
* human factors. 

We will consider visualization methods for a wide range of types of data from the points of view of both the viewer and designer/producer of graphic displays. 

## Evaluation {#evaluation}

The description below reflects the course when it was last taught in 2022.
The components and weights for evaluation are still being considered.

Grades will be based on the following components:

* **Discussion leader** (20%)
Each session, I ask that 1-2 of you will serve as discussion leader for a brief discussion on one of the readings, sub-topics or an application related
to the topic. (~ 5 min.).  I will circulate a sign-up sheet for this in the first class.

    + It may be helpful to prepare a one-page handout, or your slides, or or other visual materials. 
    + You can send these to the [class listserv](mailto:psyc6135@yorku.ca).
    <!-- post these on [eClass](https://eclass.yorku.ca/eclass/user/index.php?id=37950)  -->
    <!-- + With your permission, I will post these to the [students page](students.html) -->


* **Class presentation** (40%)
  In the last week or two, each person will give a ~ 20-25 min presentation on a topic of research, application, or software related to data visualization. The topic is not restricted to things covered in the lectures. You'll find a few random suggested topics on the [Resources page](resources.html), but you can also get a sense of the range and scope of projects from
  those listed on the [Students page](students.html)
  <!-- You are permitted to do this work with one other person. -->

    + You should prepare a brief **topic proposal** and send it to me by email by the end of Reading Week, Feb. 23.
    <!-- post it to eClass or discuss it with one of us by email by Jun 1. -->
    This is ungraded, but intended to help you shape your topic.

    + Your in-class presentation should be accompanied by a slide show or other visual materials. It would be best to
    post your presentation materials _in advance_, preferably by a link to cloud storage or as an email attachment to
    the [class listserv](mailto:psyc6135@yorku.ca).
    <!-- We encourage students to prepare -->
    <!-- and record an audio/video of your presentation _in advance_ and upload to eClass or share a link.  -->
    <!-- We would prefer to do this offline, in advance --- meaning you can record an audio/video of your presentation in advance and upload to eClass or share a link. In class discussion can then be abbreviated. -->
    <!-- Those who do post their presentation in advance will be given extra credit. -->
    
    + Evaluation of the presentation will be done by peer review as well as by the instructor. A rating form will provided.


* **Research proposal** (40%)
  Prepare a brief research proposal (~ 5-8 pages) on a data visualization topic. This can an empirical study of
  some aspect of data visualization, an historical review, or a proposal for development or implementation of
  a graphical method. The topic should not be identical to that of your presentation.
  <!-- You are permitted to do this work with one other person.  -->
  This will be due at the end of the exam period, ~ April 25.
