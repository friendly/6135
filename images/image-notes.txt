Fig 1: Probability density functions of the number of roll call vote agreements between pairs of the same-party (SP) and those pairs of cross-party (CP) pairs. The plots show the steady divergence of CPs and SP agreement rates over time.
Fig 2: Each member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949?2012 is drawn as a single node. Republican (R) representatives are in red and Democrat (D) representatives are in blue, party affiliation changes are not reflected. Edges are drawn between members who agree above the Congress? threshold value of votes. The threshold value is the number of agreements where any pair exhibiting this number of agreements is equally likely to comprised of two members of the same party (e.g. D-D or R-R), or a cross-party pair (e.g. D-R). Each node is sized relative to its total number of connections; edges are thicker if the pair agrees on more votes. The starting year of each 2-year Congress is written above the network. The network is drawn using a linear-attraction linear-repulsion model with Barnes Hut optimization

From: https://medium.com/nightingale/how-to-create-wonder-with-data-and-a-physical-object-8903f107ad11


One way to evoke wonder is to make the reader feel small in comparison. This stunning graphic from Reuters brilliantly invokes a sense of wonder by visualizing the vastness of the plastic pollution problem we face.

By combining data about the number of plastic bottles sold and an illustration of New York City, this graphic made me feel extreme awe at the extent of the problem. This pile is looming over the city ? the same city that feels enormous when I?m in it.

I already used reusable water bottles, but this graphic made me re-evaluate all the other places that I used plastic in my life and seek out alternatives (e.g., reusable plastic bags!). Wonder, care, act.

The problem of rainbow and jet palettes
What makes palettes like Jet even worse: Jet's default is red = high values.
So on a map of this data (precipitation), the blue areas assumed to be wettest would actually be driest.
Jet not only introduces false patterns, it requires one to override intuition and connotation.

color/black-and-white-trick 
The viral image was created by artist and developer
?yvind Kol?s, a prominent developer in the GIMP open-source image editor
project. Kol?s took a Creative Commons photo by Chuwa (Francis), converted it to
black-and-white, and carefully overlaid red, orange, yellow, blue, and green
grid lines over it.

?An over-saturated colored grid overlayed on a grayscale image causes the grayscale cells to be perceived as having color,? Kol?s says.

    We highlight ways for the scientific community to identify and prevent the misuse of colour in science, 
    and call for a proactive step away from colour misuse among the community, publishers, and the press.

This example shows relationship progression (over time) from first meeting to marriage.
Each dot represents a person, a colour the relationship phase that each person is in. The chart represents 1000 ?average? people. The animation on the left is the timeline for relationship progression in the 1970s. The time on the right is the progression in the 2010s.

Another way of presenting the data to suit your agenda is using colors. For most people, the color red is associated with something bad. Presenting a chart with a wall of red can be very effective in providing a sense of fear, crisis, alarm etc. to the audience. Climate change is a particularly great topic to use red as it?s also used to symbolize heat and fire.

A chart by The Guardian in the article ?What?s happening with the climate crisis and heat-trapping emissions in Australia? perfectly executes the use of red.
Notice how every country on the map is red, even countries that produce zero fossil fuel emissions would be highlighted in a pinky red. Using the exact same data, without a full red color scale, produces a chart with a much less fearful punch to it, such as the one below:

Mixing Linters with GUIs: A Color Palette Design Probe

ALT: A screenshot of our application for color palette editing. On the left side is a scatter plot with dots that can be dragged and dropped, on the right hand side are a 
collection of evaluation rules for that palette showing if the palette passed or failed those rules.

Abstract: Visualization linters are end-user facing evaluators that automatically identify potential chart issues. 
These spell-checker like systems offer a blend of interpretability and customization that is not found in other forms of automated assistance. 
However, existing linters do not model context and have primarily targeted users who do not need assistance, resulting in obvious -- even annoying -- advice. We investigate these issues within the domain of color palette design, which serves as a microcosm of visualization design concerns. We contribute a GUI-based color palette linter as a design probe that covers perception, accessibility, context, and other design criteria, and use it to explore visual explanations, integrated fixes, and user defined linting rules. Through a formative interview study and theory-driven analysis, we find that linters can be meaningfully integrated into graphical contexts thereby addressing many of their core issues. We discuss implications for integrating linters into visualization tools, developing improved assertion languages, and supporting end-user tunable advice -- all laying the groundwork for more effective visualization linters in any context.

BC Election 2024

An interesting perceptual thing: the people-vote version at the end doesn't show that the election is nearly a toss-up.

The clustering of the orange NDP dots make them look like "more" compared to the scattered blue ones
